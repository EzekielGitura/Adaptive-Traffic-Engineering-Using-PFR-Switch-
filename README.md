# SDN Switch for Smart Traffic Management

This code creates a smart switch for Software-Defined Networks (SDN) using OpenFlow and the POX controller. It builds on a basic switch to handle traffic more intelligently based on:

* **Traffic Type (TCP/UDP):** Applies different rules for each type.
* **Bandwidth and Delay:** Routes traffic for optimal performance.
* **Specific Conditions:** Redirects traffic based on custom rules.

This creates a **Policy-Based Forwarding (PFR) Switch** that can:

1. **Dynamically Redirect Traffic:** Based on bandwidth, delay, and custom rules.
2. **Balance Traffic Load:** Efficiently distribute traffic across multiple paths.
3. **Prioritize Traffic Flow:**  Prioritize real-time traffic (e.g., video calls) for smooth experience.
4. **Manage Flow Rules:** Automatically add and remove flow rules for optimal network operation.

**Use Cases:**

* **Dynamic Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across servers based on performance.
* **Traffic Engineering:**  Handle different traffic types (web, video) with specific rules.
* **Backup Routing:** Switch to alternative paths if the primary path has issues.
* **Resilient Network Management:** Ensure smooth operation even with link failures.
* **Real-World Applications:** Enterprise networks, media streaming, data centers, and telecom.
